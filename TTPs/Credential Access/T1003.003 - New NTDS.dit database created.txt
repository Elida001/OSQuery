| This query can be helpful in detecting the possible theft of the NTDS database |
| from the domain controller. It searches in the Application event log for the   |
| creation of a new NTDS database.                                               |
|                                                                                |
| There are other event IDs of interest in ESENT that can provide additional     |
| information, such as EID: 216, 326, 327. However, due to the high amount of FP |
| generated by them this query focus on the Event ID 325 (new database created)  |
|                                                                                |
