| DESCRIPTION                                                                    |
| The query gets URL activity from the Sophos journals: URL, HTTP, and DNS.      |
| The URL should be passed as a variable otherwise the query won't bring results | 
| due to the high amount of data collected by these journals. The query also     |
| uses Sophos process journal to provide additional context about the event      |
|                                                                                |

| This query can be used to get information about files downloaded/executed by   |
| searching for file extensions (.exe, .zip, .rar, .js, .ps1)                    |
|                                                                                |
