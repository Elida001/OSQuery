| Searches Exchange server logs for suspicious configurations that could indicate an      |
| attempt to exploit the CVE-2021-27065 vulnerability, focusing on invalid or unsafe URLs |
| in VirtualDirectory settings.                                                           |

| If an actor could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vuln   |
| to write a file to any path on the server                                               |

| All Set-<AppName>VirtualDirectory properties should never contain script.               |
| InternalUrl and ExternalUrl should only be valid Uris.                                  |
